> It is the `totalRP3.lua` file (not the .lua.bak files!) located in your `World of Warcraft/WTF/Account/ACCOUNT_NAME/SavedVariables` folder (replace `ACCOUNT_NAME` with your actual account name, visible on the Battle.net launcher, usually WoW1 for accounts created after the introduction of Battle.net). You can just drag and drop it here, no need for a third party service.
