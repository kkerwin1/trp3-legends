##Mary Sue Protocol
We now have a fully working MSP implementation. Total RP 3 supports ALL of the official [MSP fields](https://moonshyne.org/msp/) which isâ€¦ wellâ€¦ more than MyRoleplay actually does ðŸ˜œ

Three fields are supported as "Additional information" on the characteristics page : Nickname, Motto and House name (as TRP3 does not have specific fields for them). But that does not prevent you from be compatible : If you put one of these fields as an additional information, it will be sent to other MSP players.

For the description, based on your template:

* **Template 1** : The text is sent without any texts tags (as MRP doesn't handle them correctly, still have to contact the owner for that ...) as Description (no History).
* **Template 2** : The text is the concatenation of all frames text, separated by a line break, sent as Description (no History).
* **Template 3** : Correctly divides Description from History (Personality is not sent). Also when receiving MSP information, it will use this template.
