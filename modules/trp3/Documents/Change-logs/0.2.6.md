## New features

* **New minimap button**. We are now using [LibDataBroker] for our minimap icon. The icon is displayed on the minimap using [LibDBIcon]. If you are using a DataBroker add-on like [Titan Panel] or [Bazooka], you can decide to have the minimap button up there. You can then use the new option to hide the minimap button from the actual minimap.

* **New DataBroker plugins**. Total RP 3 now has a DataBroker module (that you can disable if you so desire) that provides several plugins to DataBroker add-ons (like [Titan Panel] or [Bazooka]). For now, the buttons from the toolbar are available (show/hide your cloak, show/hide your helmet, switch between AFK/DND or available, switch between In Character and Out Of Character, and switch to another profile). More plugins will be added as we add functions to Total RP 3.

* **New option to hide the toolbar on login**. If you are using the DataBroker plugins, you may want to hide the toolbar forever. Close the toolbar by right-clicking Total RP 3’s minimap button, then disable the “Show toolbar on login” option and it will never appear again. *As suggested by [Tiffy961]*

* **New options when creating a personal trait**. You can now choose between a pre-defined traits and creating a custom one. For now, the pre-defined traits are house name, nickname and motto (as implemented in the [Mary Sue Protocol]) and physiognomy, piercings and tattoos (borrowed from Total RP 2).

* **Added a new option for the emote detection to use both \* \* and < > to detect and color emotes in messages**.

## Bug fixes

* **Fixed a bug with the tooltip for pandaren characters without a faction yet**. *Reported by [Alicekaye].* 
* **Fixed the issue generating "<Name-Realm> not currently playing" messages**. The issue came from pet from the other faction, where Total RP 3 was sending request to their master even if they were from the other faction. *Reported by [Ranor].*

## Localization

* **Spanish localization**. *Thanks to the great folks from [Wiki Errantes] for their help.*
